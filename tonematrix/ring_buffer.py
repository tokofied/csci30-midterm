"""Part 1: a fixed-capacity ring buffer.

A queue that never grows. It holds at most `capacity` floats; enqueueing into
a full buffer or dequeueing from an empty one is an error, not a resize.

Rules for this file:
  * The storage is `array("d", ...)` of exactly `capacity` elements,
    allocated once in __init__ and never replaced. Keep it in `self._data`.
  * No list, no dict, no collections.deque, no NumPy. This is checked.
  * Every operation must run in constant time. In particular, dequeue() must
    not shuffle the remaining items down by one.
